# Welcome to my AWS API Gateway CDK Example

## Description

This project was created with the intent of experimenting with AWS CDK and API Gateway with Lambda integrations. I especially wanted to play around with static html hosting via lambda functions to facilitate a simple form for users.

I also wanted to experiment was CDK project structures, hoping to find the simplest, cleanest strategy for building lambda layers and maintaining the same import hierarchy both within the local CDK environment and the AWS console, without cluttering the project.

## Installation
